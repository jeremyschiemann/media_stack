# Fixes
## Plex indirect connection
- go to your plex server's setting -> Preferences -> Network.
- For `LAN Networks` enter your lan network e.g "192.168.1.0/24"
- For "Own URLs for accessing this server" enter "http://\<your-hosts-ip\>:\<port\>". 
 
For the ip adress use the same as for PLEX_ADVERTISE_IP
Plex's default port is 32400
